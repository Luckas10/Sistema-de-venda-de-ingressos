# ðŸŽŸ Ticket System

**Ticket System** is a basic project developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at IFRN - Campus CaicÃ³. The system simulates a ticket sales system for a cinema, allowing users to choose movies, buy tickets, and view information about their purchases.

## Key Features

- **User Login:** Users can log in or create new accounts to access the system.

- **Dashboard:** After logging in, users are directed to a main dashboard where they can navigate through different functionalities.

- **Ticket Purchase:** Users can select available movies and buy tickets for specific sessions.

- **Purchase Inquiry:** Users can inquire about their purchases using the ticket number, checking details such as room, time, and seat.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Database:** SQLite (used to store information about users, movies, and purchases)
- **Libraries:** Tkinter (for the graphical interface), SQLite3 (for interaction with the database), Pickle (for data backup).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different folders, each responsible for a specific part:

- **Screens:** Contains files related to the graphical interface, including login, dashboard, ticket purchase, purchase completed, and purchase inquiry.

- **Functions:** Contains functions and utilities related to the database, user manipulation, and system-specific operations.
